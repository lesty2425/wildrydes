# AWS Project - Wild Rydes: Build a Full End-to-End Web Application with 7 Services

## TL;DR Project Background
This project is based on the Wild Rydes serverless app by AWS and demonstrates how to build a web application using cloud-native services like Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, and DynamoDB. Inspired by local apps like Grab and Gojek, the goal was to create a fast, scalable ride-booking system that reflects my own preference for efficiency and minimal waiting time.

The app allows you to create an account and log in, then request a ride by clicking on a map (powered by ArcGIS).  The code can also be extended to build out more functionality.
