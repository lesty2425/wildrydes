# AWS Project - Wild Rydes: Build a Full End-to-End Web Application with 7 Services

## TL;DR
We're creating a web application for a unicorn ride-sharing service called Wild Rydes (from the original [Amazon workshop](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless-workshops)).  The app uses IAM, Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB, with code stored in GitHub and incorporated into a CI/CD pipeline with Amplify.

The app allows you to create an account and log in, then request a ride by clicking on a map (powered by ArcGIS).  The code can also be extended to build out more functionality.

## Cost
All services used are eligible for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).  Outside of the Free Tier, there may be small charges associated with building the app (less than $1 USD), but charges will continue to incur if you leave the app running.  Please see the end of the YouTube video for instructions on how to delete all resources used in the video.
